ent07_ErrorHandling.py 
Let's run through a few scenarios where exceptions are thrown.

Let's start with IndexError and TypeError exceptions.

I have a list of major US airlines: 
['American', 'Delta', 'United', 'Southwest', 'Frontier', 'Spirit', 'JetBlue', 'Alaska']
Select a number between 0-7: 5
You've picked Spirit

Now, select a number outside that range: 99
You picked a number outside the range and triggered an IndexError exception.
This is what Python would say:
list index out of range

Press enter to continue...

Now enter something other than a number: th
By entering something other than a number, you triggered a TypeError exception.
This is what Python would say:
list indices must be integers or slices, not str

Press enter to continue...

Now, let's look at a ZeroDivisionError exception.
Enter an integer other than zero: 30
Enter another one: 3
As it turns out 30 divided by 3 is 10.0
But if we make the second number a 0...(press enter)

We just triggered a ZeroDivisionError by dividing by 0.
This is what Python would say:
division by zero

Press enter to continue...

Here's an example of a ValueError.
Enter a positive integer: 12
The square root of that number is: 3.4641016151377544
Now give me a negative number: -5
You tried finding the square root of a negative number, triggering a ValueError exception.
This is what Python would say:
math domain error

Press enter to continue...

Finally, let's look at the IOError.
What's the filename you want to read from? Don't forget the extension: TestFile.txt
Turns out the file doesn't exist and you triggered an IOError exception.
This is what Python would say:
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'TestFile.txt'

Press enter to continue...

All errors handled effectively and the program is allowed to end.
Press enter to exit.

Users/einsteinboricua/Documents/_PythonClass/Assignment07/Assignment07_Pickling.py 
I have four data types to pickle: an integer, a string, a list, and a dictionary.

Here is the integer: 64
Pickling the integer now...
Pickled the integer
Press enter to pickle the string.

Here is the string: Python is cool
Pickling the string now...
Pickled the string
Press enter to pickle the list

Here is the list: ['United States', 'Canada', 'Mexico']
Pickling the list now...
Pickled the list
Press enter to pickle the dictionary

Here is the dictionary: {'Washington': 1, 'Lincoln': 16, 'FDR': 32}
Pickling the dictionary now...
Pickled the dictionary

Press enter to unpickle the contents

Here is the unpickled integer: 64
Here is the unpickled String: Python is cool
Here is the unpickled list: ['United States', 'Canada', 'Mexico']
Here is the unpickled dictionary: {'Washington': 1, 'Lincoln': 16, 'FDR': 32}

Review the file on the explorer for the contents.
